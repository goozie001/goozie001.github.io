			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>I'm currently pursuing my graduate degree in Computer Science at University of Florida.</p>
			<p>My first development job was as a mobile applications developer for Verigo, a startup in Gainesville, starting November of 2013. I collaborated with two developers to design and implement an iOS application that used the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol to exchange shipment and status information with our hardware chips, or 'pods', which tracked the temperature and time of their surroundings. The data collected from these chips was visualized into graphs and alerts on the application, as well as sent to our server to be viewed by remote users. After getting this application to a manageable state, I teamed with another developer to design and create the Android equivalent.</p>
			<p>During the summer of 2015, I worked as a platform-level ASP.NET web application developer for Ultimate Software. One of the number of things accomplished during this period was working with a SQL developer to reduce the amount of time it took a certain web component to load by 100%. While he improved the stored procedure used to retrieve the data, I reduced the amount of dynamic SQL calls and connections, and also the amount of calls to cached data to achieve this.</p>
			<p>For the summer of 2016, I am working on the SHIELD Android TV team at NVIDIA. I am making internal automation tools to expedite development and enhance reliability of the SHIELD product. Additionally, I am teaming with developers to identify bugs and integrate patches for upcoming Android TV releases. This includes contributing to regular code reviews on Gerrit and collaborating with SQAs to improve software quality.</p>
			<p>While I have experience in a number of languages and frameworks, I am always eager to learn something new, as design patterns spread across all languages; I'm open to the idea of almost any software development opportunity. That being said, I currently feel comfortable with Python, Java, C++, Objective-C, Android, MySQL, AngularJS, and C#.</p>
